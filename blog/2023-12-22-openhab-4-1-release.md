TODO: Write intro

With that being said, we again want to share some statistics that show the activity in numbers.

# Activity

As you'd expect from any new openHAB release, we have had a high activity across all our GitHub repositories since our [summer release](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html).
We therefore want to share a few statistics about our three main repositories: Core, add-ons and UI.

[openHAB core](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core) has received TODO pull requests, TODO bug fixes and TODO enhancements with TODO lines of code added.
The number of pull requests has TODO compared to our [summer release](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html).

TODO new add-ons were introduced, and with TODO pull requests, TODO bug fixes and TODO enhancements resulted in TODO lines of add-on code added to [openHAB add-ons](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons).

Our [openHAB web UIs](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui) have also received many contributions: TODO pull requests, TODO bug fixes and TODO enhancements resulted in TODO lines of code added.
TODO the number of pull requests compared to our [winter release](/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html).

It is worth to mention, that [our other repositories](https://github.com/openhab) have also received numerous contributions (e.g. documentation), but listing them all would probably be too much here.
Big thanks to all our contributors for driving openHAB forward!

Finally, it is time to shout out to our top code contributors per repository (having done the most commits) for this new release:

- Wouter ([@wborn](https://github.com/wborn)) for openHAB core
- Jan ([@J-N-K](https://github.com/J-N-K)) for openHAB core
- Jacob ([@jlaur](https://github.com/jlaur)) for openHAB add-ons
- Leo ([@lsiepel](https://github.com/lsiepel)) for openHAB add-ons
- Florian ([@florian-h05](https://github.com/florian-h05)) for the openHAB Main UI
- Laurent ([@lolodomo](https://github.com/lolodomo)) for the openHAB Basic UI

Most of them are also maintainers, which means besides of contributing code, they review pull requests and participate in discussions on GitHub issues.
At present, we are TODO maintainers across all our repositories.
Many thanks to my colleagues for making openHAB 4.1 a christmas present to our community!
